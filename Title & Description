Description:  
Our theater ticketing system software is designed to automate the process of selling tickets for movies. It includes features such as seat reservations, pricing options, payment processing, and the ability to generate electronic tickets for customers.  In addition to this, the software provides movie decriptions, ratings, and availability, along with other details for customers to see when browsing for their particular showing. The system will save cutomers name, email and phone number as a primary way for them to log back on to the system.
