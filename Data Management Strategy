Our Ticketing system uses one database using the SQL Data Management strategy. We used one database because it allows for simple data management and because lots of data is related.  Our database stores data of the theater ticketing system, such as customer information, ticket purchases, and showtime information. Each table represents a single entity and attributes, which for some create a relationship between the entities.
